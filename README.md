# Project Name

A reviews application for recommending and discovering places ranging from restaurants and bookstores to elementary schools and vacation destinations. HowWasIt allows users to see only the reviews and activities of friends they choose to follow. This filters out the noise created by strangers to deliver only the opinions you value most.
